[Thinkful - String Drills: Repeater](https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-string-drills-repeater)

Write a class function named repeat() that takes two arguments (a string and a long integer), and returns a new string where the input string is repeated that many times. For example:

    Repeater.repeat("a", 5)

should return

    "aaaaa"
