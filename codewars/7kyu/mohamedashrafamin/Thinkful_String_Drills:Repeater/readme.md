#     [Thinkful - String Drills: Repeater](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585a1a227cb58d8d740001c3)
  
*Write a class function named repeat() that takes two arguments (a string and a long integer), and returns a new string where the input string is repeated that many times.*

#Example:
```sh
Repeater.repeat("a", 5)
```
should return
```sh
"aaaaa"
```
