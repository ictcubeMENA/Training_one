#     [They say that only the name is long enough to attract attention. They also said that only a simple Kata will have someone to solve it series #1:Are they opposite?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/they-say-that-only-the-name-is-long-enough-to-attract-attention-they-also-said-that-only-a-simple-kata-will-have-someone-to-solve-it-this-is-a-sadly-story-number-1-are-they-opposite)

#Task

*Give you two strings: ```s1``` and ```s2```. If they are opposite, return ```true```; otherwise, return ```false```. Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.*

*The ```opposite``` means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string*

#Some examples:

```sh
isOpposite("ab","AB") should return true;
isOpposite("aB","Ab") should return true;
isOpposite("aBcd","AbCD") should return true;
isOpposite("AB","Ab") should return false;
isOpposite("","") should return false; 
```
